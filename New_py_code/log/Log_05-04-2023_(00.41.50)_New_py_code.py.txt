---

#### Basic
- [x] New project generated with `[New_py_Code]`
- [ ] Initialise a new Git with Git Bash:
    ```Git Bash
    git init
    git add.
    git commit -"Hello world"
    ```
- [ ] Create a new repository on gitHub: https://github.com/new
- [ ] Add the desired licence, for example: `MIT License` 

- [ ] Create remote access to the repository with Git Bash and push the project to GitHub.
    ```Git Bash
    git remote o https://github.com/<GitHub User name>/<repository name>
    git push o main
    ```
- [ ] ☕ Now that the base is in place Treat yourself to a cup of tea.

---
#### Start

- [ ] Start your coding
- [ ] end big step with a git commit. Add files/folders previously locked to Git to the `.gitignore` as needed. 
    ```Git Bash
    git add .
    git commit "<text>"
    git push o main
    ```
- [ ] ☕ Now that the first code is up, take some time for Tea again and write down your next steps here in the TODO file.
- [ ] 

#### The Finish

- [ ] Run the code for the final test
- [ ] If the code does what it is supposed to do, do another push into git and go into finishing.
    ```Git Bash
    git add .
    git commit "Finel Test is over!"
    git push o main
    ```
- [ ] Delete all folders and files you no longer need.
- [ ] If necessary, change `log("str)` to `print("str")` or delete the `print()` directly.
- [ ] Check your code and files for missing dokus. *ChatGPT kann dir die arbeit abnehmen use: 
    ```ChatGPT promt:
        write me a .py docstr ("""""") with the content: 
        Args, Returns, Example Usage for the code in eng.
        Use for Args and Returns "- " for a listing and for Example Usage: ">>> ".
        Here is the code: <your code Snippet>
        ```
- [ ] If you have used another language translate the code into english.
- [ ] Complete the `requirements.txt` list.
- [ ] Delete all private data from the config file.
- [ ] ☕ Have a Tea and think about the content of the ReadMe.
- [ ] Write the readme.
- [ ] check the `setup.py` if it still exists.
- [ ] check the `.gitignor` file.
- [ ] Final git Push:
    ```Git Bash
        git add .
        git commit "Touchdown! "
        git push o main
        ```
- [ ] Upload to pypi if desired : *nice guide for pypi publishing https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/python-for-hpc/tutorials/python-pypi-packaging/*

- [ ] ☕ Your are DONE! ONE LAST TEA.

This project includes a website that simplifies the process of creating the setup.py file for PyPI. The website provides users with a list of all available classifiers, which can be selected by simply clicking on them. Once the user has selected all the relevant classifiers, they can generate the code for their PyPI project with just a few clicks.

This streamlined process can save developers time and effort, allowing them to focus on the more important aspects of their PyPI project. With this website, developers can quickly and efficiently generate the necessary code to get their project up and running.

To get started, simply visit the website and select the relevant classifiers for your project. Once you have made your selections, generate the code and add it to your PyPI project.
